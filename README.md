Features
Automated API Testing: Send HTTP requests and validate responses automatically.

Test Report Generation: Generate comprehensive test reports for executed test cases.

Configurable Test Cases: Define and manage test cases with ease.

Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms for reliable test execution.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Devendra2803/APIAUTO.git
cd APIAUTO
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your test data:

Place your API test cases in the data/ directory.

Ensure that each test case includes the necessary request parameters and expected responses.

Run the test script:

bash
Copy
